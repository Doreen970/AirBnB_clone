This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone
this project test our knowledge on OOP of python that we learnt 
it focuses on class instances and object and inheritance the cmd module is used for the interactivity of the program 
to use the cmd module we firstt import it 
we then create a class that inherit the cmd module by writting cmd.cmd inside its parenthesis after defining the class
example
class abdi(cmd.cmd)
now to use this cmd module you will have to run the file that contains it
